Title : MARS framework development for multi-layer management

Description : Our research group has developed a software framework for developing resource management policies called Middleware for Adaptive-Reflective Systems(MARS). The framework allows modular definition of policies for managing different resources both dependent and independent. MARS currently includes limited support for the ODROID-XU3, NVIDIA-TX2, and gem5 platforms. The framework is extendible to additional platforms, as well as sensors and actuators on existing platforms.
