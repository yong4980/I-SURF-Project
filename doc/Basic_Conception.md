### Docker

Docker is a tool designed to make it easier to create, deploy, and run applications by using containers. 

Containers allow a developer to package up an application with all of the parts int needs, such as libraries and other dependencies, and ship it all out as on package. 

Docker is a bit like a virtual machine. But unlike a virtual machine, rather than creating a whole virtual operating system, Docker allows applications to use the same Linux kernel as the system that they're running on and only requires applications be shipped with things not already running on the host computer.

Image is a file, comprised of multiple layers, used to execute code in a Docker container. An image is essentially built from the instructions for a complete and executable version of an application, which relies on the host OS kernel.
